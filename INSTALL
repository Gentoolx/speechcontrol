Installing
=================

1. Building
Commands for building SpeechControl are boilerplate-like.

$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
$ make
# make install

After that, you can invoke 'speechcontrol' from the command line.

2. Needed Libraries
SpeechControl needs Qt and PocketSphinx's development files to build.

$ apt-get install cmake libqt4-dev libpocketsphinx-dev libsphinxbase-dev libboost-python-dev libboost-dev

That'll fix any dependencies.
