## Introduction

SpeechControl's the attempt of the Synthetic Intellect Institute to
provide an efficient means of speech recognition technologies to the
Linux desktop. SpeechControl is a speech recognition toolkit, allowing
you to:

  * train multiple acoustic models
  * manipulate and redistribute sessions made with SpeechControl.
  * upload session information to VoxForge
  * dictate text to applications
  * control your desktop using arbitrary commands
  * provide speech recognition to other applications

## Bug Reporting

Any and all bugs should be reported to http://bugs.thesii.org
That link points to the issue tracking system used to maintain any and all
activities pertaining to SpeechControl. The exact link for bug reporting
when it comes to SpeechControl is
http://bugs.thesii.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=speechcontrol.

It's recommended that you first test if SpeechControl works on your system
and then try debugging SpeechControl. To produce meaningful information
for SpeechControl bug reporting, try building SpeechControl with
CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE set to 'RelWithDebInfo' or 'Debug'. Check the INSTALL
file for more information about the build and execution cycle of SpeechControl.

It's also recommended that if you're testing or building SpeechControl and would
like to produce a useful report that you run SpeechControl under a debugger like
the GNU Debugger (gdb). To do so, from the terminal, invoke the following:

    $ gdb 'src/app/speechcontrol'

You should then re-run the same procedure you invoked to cause that error to
occur and provide this information in a bug report on the Institute's tracker at
http://bugs.thesii.org. You can provide more information by taking a look at
README.tests.

## Contact
You can reach the development team behind SpeechControl at their
mailing list spchcntrl-devel@thesii.org. The people who helped produce
and also use SpeechControl have a mailing list at spchcntrl-users@thesii.org.
You can openly subscribe and add content to both of these mailing lists.
Thank you for using our software. More information regarding SpeechControl
