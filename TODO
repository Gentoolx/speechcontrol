*** To see a live list of TODOs, we recommend that you
*** use Doxygen to generate all of the @todo mentions
*** in the source code or invoke in a terminal window from
*** the source directory:
***
***   $ cat `find . | grep .cpp` | grep @todo
***
*** Completed tasks have a (!), whereas incompleted tasks have a (*).
*** Tasks in progress should have a (-) as its indicator.
*** At the end of each task description, a bug number (bug #NNN) is typically provided.
