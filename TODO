Library
----------------------------------------------------------
* List audio devices. (bug #000006)
* Get selected audio device's volume. (bug #000007)
 * Get threshold of user's input for typical speaking volume.
 * Offset that result to determine background noise.

Application (general)
----------------------------------------------------------
* Construct individual segmentation audio recording; the recording of audio files to chunks, permitting undo and marginal training support.
* Permit serialization to tarballs of segmented audio recording.
* Correct the CMake build system to use sub-directories for each layer of code and UI.
* Implement D-Bus integration of application.
* Implement an abstract means of displaying notifications (includes QSystemTrayIcon, indicators, etc). [Going to use QIndicate for this.]
* Build functionality for Ayanta notifications.
* Hook into speechcontrold and allow modifying of local user options.
* Integrate the code for the training utilities of SphinxTrain to the SpeechControl application.


Application (daemon)
----------------------------------------------------------
* Work on adding D-Bus support.
* Perhaps using an unique header that allows developers to wrap around the D-Bus code?
    - Would need to export this header to C for binding support.
* Implement the ability to queue instances of recognition.
* Implement a configuration file (per-user and system) for default devices and options.
    - Dump possible values for each configuration on command-line when queried.
    - Warn about invalid/incompatible values and revert to default.
* Implement a logging system (NONE, MININAL, WARNING, INFORMATIVE, DEBUG, VERBOSE, FULL)

Miscellaneous
----------------------------------------------------------
* Re-work SpeechControl to have a daemon run in the background that handles all of the speech recognition requests (speechcontrold).
* Work on the theming for the documentation.
* Exclude the plug-in's code from the documentation.
! For Sphinx-related libraries create CMake modules instead of using pkg-config. -- Adrian Borucki <gentoolx@gmail.com>
