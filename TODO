*** To see a live list of TODOs, we recommend that you

*** Completed tasks have a (!), whereas incompleted tasks have a (*).
*** Tasks in progress should have a (-) as its indicator.
*** At the end of each task description, a bug number (bug #NNN) is typically provided.

Library
----------------------------------------------------------
! List audio devices. (bug #000006) [jalcine]
! Get selected audio device's volume. (bug #000007) [jalcine]
 * Get threshold of user's input for typical speaking volume.
 * Offset that result to determine background noise.
! Implement the programmatic representation of the acoustic model. (bug #000029) [jalcine]
* Consider adding a means of reading the binary data of acoustic models.

Application (general)
----------------------------------------------------------
! Construct individual segmentation audio recording; the recording of audio files to chunks, permitting undo and marginal training support. (bug #000008) [jalcine]
- Permit serialization to tarballs of segmented audio recording. (bug #000009) [jalcine]
* Correct the CMake build system to use sub-directories for each layer of code and UI. (bug #000010)
- Implement D-Bus integration of application. (bug #000011) [jalcine]
* Hook into speechcontrold and allow modifying of local user options for the daemon. (bug #000013)
* Add support for multiple languages (i18n) into SpeechControl. (bug #000022)
* Add more tests for the UI.
* Generate icons for Voxforge.
* Determine if adding icons to /usr/share/icons/hicolor/*x* would make icon detection better.
* Segment the core of the application into an external component that can be used by other programming languages.
* Consider merging the AbstractAgent class into the Services::AbstractModule class.

Application (daemon)
----------------------------------------------------------
! Work on adding D-Bus support. (bug #000016) [jalcine]
* Implement the ability to queue instances of recognition. (bug #000017)
* Implement a configuration file (per-user and system) for default devices and options. (bug #000018)
    - Dump possible values for each configuration on command-line when queried.
    - Warn about invalid/incompatible values and revert to default.

Miscellaneous
----------------------------------------------------------
* Re-work SpeechControl to have a daemon run in the background that handles all of the speech recognition requests (speechcontrold). (bug #000020)
! Work on the theming for the documentation. (bug #000021) [jalcine]
! Add more test-cases for the library, application and daemon. [jalcine]
! For Sphinx-related libraries create CMake modules instead of using pkg-config. -- [gentoolx]
* Produce more informative documentation (see TODO.docs on branch 'docs')
