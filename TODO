Library
----------------------------------------------------------
* List audio devices. (bug #000006)
* Get selected audio device's volume. (bug #000007)
 * Get threshold of user's input for typical speaking volume.
 * Offset that result to determine background noise.
* Implement the programmatic representation of the acoustic model. (bug #000029)

Application (general)
----------------------------------------------------------
* Construct individual segmentation audio recording; the recording of audio files to chunks, permitting undo and marginal training support. (bug #000008)
* Permit serialization to tarballs of segmented audio recording. (bug #000009)
* Correct the CMake build system to use sub-directories for each layer of code and UI. (bug #000010)
* Implement D-Bus integration of application. (bug #000011)
* Hook into speechcontrold and allow modifying of local user options for the daemon. (bug #000013)
* Integrate the code for the training utilities of SphinxTrain to the SpeechControl application. (bug #000014)
* Add support for multiple languages (i18n) into SpeechControl. (bug #000022)
* Add more tests for the UI.

Application (daemon)
----------------------------------------------------------
* Work on adding D-Bus support. (bug #000016)
    - Perhaps using an unique header that allows developers to wrap around the D-Bus code?
    - Would need to export this header to C for binding support.
* Implement the ability to queue instances of recognition. (bug #000017)
* Implement a configuration file (per-user and system) for default devices and options. (bug #000018)
    - Dump possible values for each configuration on command-line when queried.
    - Warn about invalid/incompatible values and revert to default.
* Implement a logging system (NONE, MININAL, WARNING, INFORMATIVE, DEBUG, VERBOSE, FULL) (bug #000019)

Miscellaneous
----------------------------------------------------------
* Re-work SpeechControl to have a daemon run in the background that handles all of the speech recognition requests (speechcontrold). (bug #000020)
* Work on the theming for the documentation. (bug #000021)
* Add more test-cases for the library, application and daemon.
