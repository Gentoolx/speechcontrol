 * @section intro Introduction
 *
 * SpeechControl is the attempt by the Synthetic Intellect Institute to provide
 * a unifed base of speech recognition technologies from multiple groups like
 * CMU's PocketSphinx and the Julius group (tba) into one cross-platform and
 * easy to use solution. With no frills and more flexibility, this library is
 * designed to make your developing life a bit easier to have with some of the
 * magic tools of speech recognition and computation that's involved with it.
