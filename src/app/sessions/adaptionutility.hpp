/**
 * @brief Provides SpeechControl with the ability to adapt sessions into existing acoustic models.
 *
 * AdaptationUtility performs most of the actions required to perform an adaption as
 * prescribed by <http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/wiki/tutorialadapt>. The process is
 * typically as follows:
 *
 * @li Obtain the feature parameters of the acoustic model to be adapted. ( @c generateFeatures() )
 * @li Convert the model definitions from its binary format into a text format. ( @c convertModelDefinitions() )
 * @li Obtain statistical information about the acoustic model. ( @c collectAcousticStatistics() )
 * @li Enacts the adaption process, MAP-style. ( @c performAdaptation() )
 * @li Re-generate the sendmap file (to save disk space) ( @c generateSendmap() )
 * @li Generate statistical information about the accuracy and efficiency of the newly adopted model. ( @c generateAccuracyReport() )
 *
 * More information about adaption in SpeechControl can be found at <http://wiki.thesii.org/SpeechControl/AdaptingAcousticModels>.
