 * @brief Abstract class defining commands for desktop control.
 * The abstract command interface provides a common base for all possible
 * commands to be defined with desktop control. All commands are expected to
 * have a definable statement, something that the user can know to say to
 * expect a command to be invoked, a verification method that checks if the
 * input string fits closely to what is expected to be, and an invocation slot
 * that takes one argument optionally to solidify the action's potential.
