Plug-ins for SpeechControl
----------------------------------------------------

0. Notice

The purpose of extending SpeechControl was mainly to provide it
with features that the developers wouldn't have thought of to include
in the core application or have felt that wouldn't fit with the design of
it. This directory holds the collection of plug-ins that are now packaged
along with SpeechControl for the user to use at whim. These plug-ins are
referred to as the 'Supported Plug-ins' and receive official support from
the SpeechControl Development team.
