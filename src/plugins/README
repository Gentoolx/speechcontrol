Plug-ins for SpeechControl
----------------------------------------------------

0. Notice

The purpose of extending SpeechControl was mainly to provide it
with features that the developers wouldn't have thought of to include
in the core application or have felt that wouldn't fit with the design of
it. This directory holds the collection of plug-ins that are now packaged
along with SpeechControl for the user to use at whim. These plug-ins are
referred to as the 'Supported Plug-ins' and receive official support from
the SpeechControl Development team.

1. Building

None of the plug-ins will register into the build system until you
either install the headers for SpeechControl and its CMake information
or manually point the plug-ins to the generated CMake information of the
application. This is because (obviously) the plug-ins require the headers
of the application in order to properly build. If the source code of the
plug-in API changes too much, it'd be impossible to build the code unless
it is rewritten to match it accordingly.

With CMake, however, the plug-ins refuse to build if the headers aren't found.
So for now, you'll have to comment out the 'add_subdirectory(plugins)' command
in 'src/CMakeLists.txt' and then try to build (and install) the code. After
you've satisfied that, you can uncomment that line once more and then attempt
building the plug-in.
