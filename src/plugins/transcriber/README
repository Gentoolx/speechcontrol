Transcriber for SpeechControl
----------------------------------------------------------------

0. Introduction

The Transcriber plug-in for SpeechControl permits end-users to take pre-existing
audio, be it over a network stream or a local file, and recognize as much text
in the stream as possible into text.

1. Usability

Such a function could provide useful for users that tend to listen to pod-casts
very often but would like to obtain a textual representation of what they're
listening to. Another use case of the transcriber is taking audio messages sent
over e-mail and transcribing them into text. (Perhaps an in-line audio
transcriber for e-mail clients like KMail, Thunderbird and Evolution is in
order?)
