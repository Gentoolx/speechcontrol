Ideas
---------------------------------------
This file contains a list of ideas of plug-ins that could be
built for SpeechControl.

* {{ Application Starter }} [Implementation in Progress]
  Quite similar to how Ubuntu Unity's Dash can invoke applications
  or even how KDE's KRunner or Kickoff can do likewise, the application
  starter plug-in allows users to merely state an application they'd
  wish to run and see it invoked. It should be extremely quiet and
  do its best not to disturb the current flow of executional operation.
  For one, we *definitely* need the indicator to be implemented so that
  SpeechControl can run in the background.

* {{ Menu Listing }}
  By using dbusmenu-qt, we could obtain the current menubar of
  an application (the top-most) and provide those actions as
  possible matches for the result. If possible, we could also
  go as far as to provide all windows and rank them by the last
  window activated or selected (if permissible).

** {{ Window Management }}
  Assuming that all window managers communicate equally, and
  that they also can communicate over D-Bus, we can manage windows
  by manipulating lists of windows. Commands like 'Show window Chrome'
  or 'Hide all windows' could be used.

** {{ Session Management }} [Implementation in Progress]
  Another D-Bus based plug-in (since it rocks :D), we could allow
  the user to implement specific terms for logging out, logging in,
  locking sessions, shut-down, restarting and suspending their computers.
  Perhaps also useful is having a code-word that the user can append to
  the end of the statement to skip confirmation.

** {{ Accessibility Management }}
  Perhaps another cobblestone of efficency, SpeechControl, with the
  help of AT-SPI tech, could manage and manipulate certain accessibility
  features on the computer like MouseKeys, StickyKeys, etc. Such a setup
  would be useful for users that can't use the keyboard. It'd need to
  chain up with a speech synthesizer or braille output mechanism, though,
  so most likely this'd be defined externally.
