Tests in SpeechControl
-----------------------------------------------------------

0. Introduction

SpeechControl is a data-driven, dynamically used application. For such an
application, tests are required in order to ensure that users, developers
and packagers alike can see SpeechControl working correctly.

SpeechControl uses the QtTest system in conjunction with CDash and CTest so that
the developers here at the Synthetic Intellect Institute can collect, assess and
determine problems when they happen, how they'd occur and discern on a effective
way to solve them.

1. CDash & Bugzilla

Being that SpeechControl (and most, if not all of the Institute's software
projects) use CMake and Qt, we've used CTest and CDash extensively to ensure a
working and stable system for our testing framework. CDash provides a dashboard,
hosted on the Institute's server, allowing anyone to view and examine uploaded
test information. The URI to this page is http://dev.thesii.org/testboard.

With a bit of integration with Bugzilla, our bug tracking system, tests can be
referred to by their invocation index in CDash and new bugs can be created auto-
matically in CDash, thus closing the gap between testing and bug reporting.
