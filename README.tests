Tests in SpeechControl
-----------------------------------------------------------

0. Introduction

SpeechControl is a data-driven application. For such an
application, tests are required in order to ensure that users,
developers and packagers alike can see SpeechControl working
correctly in their own environments.

SpeechControl uses the QtTest system in conjunction with Experiri
and CTest so that the developers here at the Synthetic Intellect
Institute can collect, assess and determine problems when they happen,
how they'd occur and discern on a effective way to solve them.

1. CDash & Bugzilla

Being that SpeechControl (and most, if not all of the Institute's software
projects) use CMake and Qt, we've used CTest and Experiri extensively to ensure a
working and stable system for our testing framework. Experiri provides a dashboard,
hosted on the Institute's server, allowing anyone to view and examine uploaded
test information. The URI to this page is http://developers.thesii.org/testing/dashboard
