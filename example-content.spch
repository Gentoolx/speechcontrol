  <Title>Perfectionism: A Theory</Title>

  <Text>There’s a great deal of people out there in the world that I’ve interacted with and on some scales, inadvertently modified my perspective of the world. Such an event is common in everyday life; it’s exactly how our brains grow. This concept’ll continue to explain my current perspective of the ability to become perfect. We learn in blocks, simple tiny links that expand and bloat into blobs of data we’d like to call memory, but are known as neural nets. These nets bend, flex and retract with input from our raw stimuli and the experiences stored in the cortex (that’s some, not all of the input sources). We take in EVERYTHING in our environment, the only logical way is to amputate the input device itself (ie: mouth, eyes, ears, hands, genitals, feet, etc). Our environment is a constant source of information, spilling a plethora of information into the cerebral cortex and into what we’d like to call our mind. Now, with this said, how can society prevent the negative inflictions it brings about? Hatred, stereotyping, “racism”, religious intolerance, lynching, wars, brutality? It’s human nature to do some kind of wrong, mainly because initially they don’t know any better. The duty of a human caretaker (whether it be a parent, guardian, Nun) is to ensure that a child is raised in such a manner that would ensure the chances of raising a socially, mentally, academically-willing, and emotionally stable individual. By accomplishing this, it’s said to be capable of carrying out a perfect life, due to the assumption that such an up-bringing would foster a successful, stable and well-rounded person. According to society, the idea of perfection is a skewed one, simply because, neurologically, we are nothing alike, not even twins. Perfection in terms of pleasing the masses is as likely to be possible as a creature that happens to fall under every species in the animal, insect and plant kingdoms, or creating a device that does everything and anything. Things like this don’t happen, at least not yet (people believe cell phones would never exist, or the ability for humans to fly via planes). Until then, we’d have to conform to a particularly closed sense of perfection, of which happens to have many degrees. Perfection, according to Wiktionary is: a quality, endowment, or acquirement completely excellent; an ideal; faultlessness; especially, the divine attribute of complete excellence. in the sense of it being an attribute. The quality or state of being perfect or complete, so that nothing requisite is wanting; entire development; consummate culture, skill, or moral excellence; the highest attainable state or degree of excellence; maturity; [as, perfection in an art, in a science, or in a system; perfection in form or degree; fruits in perfection]. The first definition is more sturdy than the second definition, and there’s one word that causes such a difference that I instantaneously noticed. MATURITY. This is a constantly changing concept in the world; probably as inconsistent as language itself. Until an universal standard of maturity can be not only set up and accepted, but be put in pursuit for, it’d be extremely more logical to approach a universal sense of perfection. Society doesn’t directly look for perfection, at least not in the sense you’d perceive. Traditionally, perfection was decided by political status with an empire (Cesar & Rome), but then became more … abstract? as science began to blossomed (partly because of science’s attempt to disprove religion). I, for one, cannot see a definite standard of perfection, but I do have my own for myself and this is another idea that’s kicked about, self-perfection. By definition, you’d assume that this act is purely designed to complete yourself in a perfect way.</Text>
