  <Text>There's a great deal of people out there in the world that I've interacted with and on some scales, inadvertently modified my perspective of the world. Such an event is common in everyday life; it's exactly how our brains grow. This concept'll continue to explain my current perspective of the ability to become perfect. We learn in blocks, simple tiny links that expand and bloat into blobs of data we'd like to call memory, but are known as neural nets. These nets bend, flex and retract with input from our raw stimuli and the experiences stored in the cortex (that's some, not all of the input sources). We take in EVERYTHING in our environment, the only logical way is to amputate the input device itself (ie: mouth, eyes, ears, hands, genitals, feet, etc). Our environment is a constant source of information, spilling a plethora of information into the cerebral cortex and into what we'd like to call our mind. Now, with this said, how can society prevent the negative inflictions it brings about?</Text>
