SpeechControl is a speech recognition toolkit, allowing\r\nyou to:\r\n\r\n  * train multiple acoustic models\r\n  * manipulate and redistribute sessions made with SpeechControl.\r\n  * upload session information to VoxForge\r\n  * dictate text to applications\r\n  * control your desktop using arbitrary commands\r\n  * provide speech recognition to other applications\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nFor more detailed instructions look into the INSTALL file.\r\nUsual build procedure is as follows:\r\n\r\n    $ mkdir build && cd build\r\n    $ cmake ..\r\n    $ make\r\n    # make install\r\n\r\nNote that it *won't* build any plug-ins, documentation and tests.\r\n\r\n## Bug Reporting\r\n\r\nAny and all bugs should be reported to http://bugs.thesii.org\r\nThat link points to the issue tracking system used to maintain any and all\r\nactivities pertaining to SpeechControl. The exact link for bug reporting\r\nwhen it comes to SpeechControl is\r\nhttp://bugs.thesii.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=speechcontrol.\r\n\r\nIt's recommended that you first test if SpeechControl works on your system\r\nand then try debugging SpeechControl. To produce meaningful information\r\nfor SpeechControl bug reporting, try building SpeechControl with\r\nCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE set to 'RelWithDebInfo' or 'Debug'. Check the INSTALL\r\nfile for more information about the build and execution cycle of SpeechControl.\r\n\r\nIt's also recommended that if you're testing or building SpeechControl and would\r\nlike to produce a useful report that you run SpeechControl under a debugger like\r\nthe GNU Debugger (gdb). To do so, from the terminal, invoke the following:\r\n\r\n    $ gdb 'src/app/speechcontrol'\r\n\r\nYou should then re-run the same procedure you invoked to cause that error to\r\noccur and provide this information in a bug report on the Institute's tracker at\r\nhttp://bugs.thesii.org. You can provide more information by taking a look at\r\nREADME.tests.\r\n\r\n## Contact\r\nYou can reach the development team behind SpeechControl at their\r\nmailing list spchcntrl-devel@thesii.org. The people who helped produce\r\nand also use SpeechControl have a mailing list at spchcntrl-users@thesii.org.\r\nYou can openly subscribe and add content to both of these mailing lists.\r\nThank you for using our software.
